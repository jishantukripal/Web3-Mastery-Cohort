# 🛠️ Week 1 Assignment

This file contains the week1 assignment answer.

## 📦 Step 1: Install MetaMask
- Download the MetaMask extension from the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/). 🦊
- Create a new wallet and save your seed phrase securely! 🔐
- Created Eth Address: `0xC5F1D3445f4c7a21A1e9fE25f6C749cb7fd24087`

## 🖥️ Step 2: Access Remix IDE
- Open the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- Create a new **workspace** and give it a name like `Web3-Mastery-Cohort`. 📂

## ✍️ Step 3: Write Your First Smart Contract
- Create a new file called `SimpleStorage.sol` in the workspace.
- Write the following Solidity code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 public favoriteNumber;
}
```


## 🛠️ Step 4: Compile & Deploy the Contract using Remix VM
- In the Solidity Compiler tab in Remix, select the Solidity version 0.8.25.
- Click the Compile button. ✅
- Ensure the compilation is successful (a green checkmark should appear). If there are errors, Remix will show them, and you can fix them easily.

- In the Deploy & Run Transactions tab, select the VM environment.
- Click Deploy to deploy the contract locally.
- Your contract will appear under Deployed Contracts.

## ✔️ No Errors!
The contract has been deployed and tested successfully without any errors or issues! 🎉

Thank You !!
